# opengl-starter
Starting point for OpenGL projects, cross platform (Linux, OSX, Windows)

Currently untested in OSX and Windows, but should work?

Uses cross platform libraries and compiles all dependencies part of the project so you can just checkout and go.

Uses CMake to build.

Libraries used:
* glfw (3.1.2)
* GLEW (1.12.0)
* glm (0.9.6)
